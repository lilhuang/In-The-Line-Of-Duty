Because there is no direction yet in this game, this is how stuff works in case you need some guidance:

When each level begins, you need to construct the world with paths and "bounce tiles" so that the ball can find its way to the target. The ball is a yellow circle; the target is a  yellow halo. When you want to draw a path, click the "draw path" button, and then click your mouse anywhere inside the box and drag to create a line. When you want to create a tile, click the "set tile" button, and then click your mouse anywhere inside the box. This should instantiate a bounce tile, where the white strip shows which way is the top (where the ball would bounce off of). Once the tile is selected, you can rotate the tile by scrolling back and forth. You can also unselect the tile by clicking a place on the screen not on the tile. In order to instantiate another one, click the button again and then you can create another one. In order to run the game after creating the environment, click the "run" button, and the ball should start falling. If you get stuck, you can reset the level by clicking the "reset" button.

In the game, there are 2 "special" things: pickups and wormholes. Eventually, collecting pickups while playing will earn you more points. With wormholes, if you fall into one of them, you will come out the other one at the same speed as you went into the first one. Pairs of wormholes are indicated by having the same color (so two purple ones are paired, two pink ones are paired, etc).

Last thing: the halo isn't working properly with the target. So, that weird sliver of yellow you see around the screen is the target. It's supposed to be a full halo but for some reason it won't show up; I will fix this by next week.
